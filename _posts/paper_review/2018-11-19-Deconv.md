* VGG16 + Deconvolutional Network (The mirrored VGG16)
* Dense pixel-wise class probability map is obtained.
* unpooling capture *example-specific* structures
  * reconstruct the detailed structure of an object in finer resolution
* Learned filters capture *class-specific* shapes
  * deconvolutions, the activations closely related to the target classes are amplified while noisy activations from other regions are suppressed.

### Training
* Batch normalization
* 2-stage traning :
  * easy examples (crop object instances using ground-truth annotations, so that an object is centered at the cropped bounding box)
  * fine-tune with more challenging examples (object proposals: Candidate proposals sufficiently overlapped with ground-truth segmentations are selected for training)
    * Generate sufficient number of candidate proposals
    * Apply trained network to obtain semantic segmentation maps of individual proposals
    * Aggregate the output of all proposals

### Inference
* Employ edge-box to generate object proposals.
