### Done

* The summary of dataset used in former algorithm for medical image segmentation. The result is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1la5dfzOgthHWVfIjDh3iWICfKJUqDOiI/view?usp=sharing)
* More detailed paper review. [link]()
* A first trial of convolutional neural network for medical image segmentation:
  * dataset resolve using [*nibabel*](http://nipy.org/nibabel/)
  * The [roadmap](https://xysong1201.github.io/study%20notes/2018/12/05/road-map-parse-name/) to how to parse medical image into Python.

### Questions and Problems encountered and the things to do
* How to deal with the medical dataset in Python and Pytorch.
  * Import data (how to import the medical format dataset)
  * Visualization of the data (in 2D and 3D)
* Data collect
  * Collect data from different datasets public available.
  * Try to set the same resolution for all the dataset.
  * Understand the data structure
