### Done
* The coding of Unet model in PyTorch. [Link](https://github.com/xysong1201/unet__pytorch/blob/master/Unet.ipynb)
* Learning the dataloading and processing tutorial via [Pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html)


### Problems encountered
* [BSDS500 dataset](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/BSR/BSR_bsds500.tgz) can't be downloaded.
    * Using Matlab:
```matlab
websave('BSD500.tgz','http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/BSR/BSR_bsds500.tgz');
```
```
Error using websave (line 107)
The server returned the status 301 with message "Moved Permanently" in response to the request to URL
https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/BSR/BSR_bsds500.tgz.
```
    * Using terminal
    The file downloaded is damaged all the time.
