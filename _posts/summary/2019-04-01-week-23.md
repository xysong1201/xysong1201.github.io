2. Code observation, download codes from [source](https://github.com/ai-med/quickNAT_pytorch), and try to reproduce the QuickNAT. (still under development)

### Increase the batch size

Set up 3 experiments:

|batch size|group id|parameter numbers|GPU used|
|4|3|13,177,026|6617Mb|
|4|3|52,633,794|7867Mb|
|8|3|52,633,794|10113Mb|

## To do
Using the reproduced QuickNAT to do the train/validation/test
