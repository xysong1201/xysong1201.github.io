## Done
* Study the [Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) of deeplearning.ai authored by [Andrew N](https://www.andrewng.org/).
* Study the [Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning) of deeplearning.ai authored by [Andrew N](https://www.andrewng.org/), The study note is [here](https://xysong1201.github.io/study%20notes/2018/11/12/study-note-2/).
* Install FreeSurfer in remote server
* Implementation of a simple LeNet-5 using Pytorch at the remote server using the GPU. The code is [here](https://github.com/xysong1201/SegmentationImage) 
* Paper review of ABhijit, Sailesh, Debdoot et al.[Error Corrective Boosting for Learning Fully Convolutional Networks with Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00938)
* Learn some typical techniques of image segmentation from this [site](https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io/artificial-inteligence/content/image_segmentation.html)

## Next steps
* Be familor with FreeSurfer.
* Build a Fully Convulutional network using Pytorch.
