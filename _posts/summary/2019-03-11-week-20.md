### Finding the learning rate
Put all the results got last week together, we get:

<center>Fig. 1 Loss for group 5 with different loss strategy </center>
After 720 epoch, the minimum loss we could reach is *2.00*.

Set four more experiments:
1. slice5, initial learning rate: 0.001, step_size = 100, gamma = 0.9, 2000 epochs
2. slice0, initial learning rate: 0.001, step_size = 100, gamma = 0.8, 1100 epochs
3. slice1, initial learning rate: 0.001, step_size = 100, gamma = 0.8, 1100 epochs
4. slice2, initial learning rate: 0.001, step_size = 100, gamma = 0.8, 1100 epochs
