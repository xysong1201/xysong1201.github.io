### Done

* Accomplish both the tutorial and the programing assignments of  [Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/home/welcome) of deeplearning.ai in Coursera.

* Paper review of:

* Freesurfer tutorial (40% finished)


### To do
* Build a first convNet in PyTorch.
* Be familiar with Pytorch


### Ideas
* Can we imitate the QuickNAT by using the output labeled data of QuickNAT/PICSL as the training data for our network.
