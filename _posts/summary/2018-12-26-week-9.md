### Done

* Solve the image visualization problem existed last week.

* Try to Understanding Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss, Binary Cross-Entropy Loss, Softmax Loss, Logistic Loss, Focal Loss. [link](https://gombru.github.io/2018/05/23/cross_entropy_loss/)

* Try to use 3 concatenated random cropped image datasets as a whole training set, the total number of training number is 480, the source code is [here](https://github.com/xysong1201/image_segmentation). The experiments are as follows:

|Number| Data source   | Training Sample  | epoch of training  | Batch size | learning rate | cropped size| momentum | Mimimum loss attained |
|----|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---:|
|01|KITTI|480|20|1|0.001|128|0.9|0.651|
|02|KITTI|480|20|1|0.0001|128|0.9|0.672|
|03|KITTI|480|20|1|0.25|128|0.9|0.686|
|04|KITTI|480|20|1|0.25, every 5 epoch divide by 5|256|0.9|0.620|
|05|KITTI|480|20|1|0.5, every 5 epoch divide by 5|256|0.9|0.634|

* Try to use other datasets to study the image segmentation(still need to fix the loss function problem):
  * [dataset](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/tem.en.html)
  * [code](https://github.com/xysong1201/image_segmentation)

* Review of cs231n blog, especially the [loss function](https://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/#loss)

### To do
1.  Hyperparameter still need to be tuned
2.  Figure out why the loss doesn't decrease
3.  Try to train the network using non-cropped image for the KITTI datasets
3.  More Experiments
