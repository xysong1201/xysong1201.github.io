### Done:
* Experiments with [KITTI semantic segmentation datasets](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_semseg.php?benchmark=semantics2015). It consists of 200 semantically annotated train as well as 200 test images corresponding to the KITTI Stereo and Flow Benchmark 2015.
* [Github link](https://github.com/xysong1201/unet_segmentation) Completed:
    * Dataloader constructed
    * Training the data
    * Note: 1 batch, 1 image consume about 3000 Mbps memory in GPU
* Experiments:

| Data source   | Training Sample  | epoch of training  | Mimimum loss attained |
|-------------|:-----:|:-----:|----:|
|KITTI|#200|2|0.798|
| KITTI | #200| 10|0.603|

### Next:
1. Try to do the cross-validation according to the blog [CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/classification/), in order to tune the Hyperparameter.
