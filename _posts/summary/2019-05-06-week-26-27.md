### Mistake correction
I thought the data range was not in [0,255] because I only observed one image data. But the total image data range is [0,255], because for that one specific case, the maximum data value is 172. So the original Dataset is applicable for the brainmask case.

### Count the 0, 1, 2 pattern
In order to count the number of each value in the brainmask, create a for loop over all the data, and find out the weight of the target.

Result:

`[762254385 219591523   2177132] for [0. 1. 2.]`

### Buid up Resnet
build up 10 layers, 18 layers, 34 layers, 50 layers and 152 layers Resnet
