### Learning rate tuning
Tuning the learning rate in order to find the suitable learning rate strategy for slice 5.  
I tried three strategy of learning rate using `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size, gamma=0.1, last_epoch=-1)` in Pytorch, where the `gamma` represent the factor of learning rate decay, `step_size` indicates the Period of learning rate decay.
- learning_rate's initial value: 0.002, gamma: 0.5,  step_size: 150
- learning_rate's initial value: 0.001, gamma: 0.8, step_size: 100
- no scheduler, learning_rate: 0.001

- epoch 0-150, lr=0.002
- epoch 150-300, lr=0.001
- epoch 300-450: lr = 0.0005
- epoch 450-600: lr = 0.00025
- epoch 600-750: lr = 0.000125
<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/s5_8.jpg" height="350" width="450"></center>
- epoch 0-100: lr = 0.001,
- epoch 100-200: lr = 0.0008
- epoch 200-300: lr = 0.00064
- epoch 300-400: lr = 0.000512
- epoch 400-500: lr = 0.0004096
- epoch 500-600: lr = 0.00032768

- lr = 0.001


Since observing that the loss doesn't decrease efficiently after 300 epochs, another strategy is used by `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.MultiStepLR(optimizer, milestones, gamma=0.1, last_epoch=-1)`, whiche means for certain periods of epochs, the learning rate stays constant.
- learning_rate's initial value: 0.001, gamma = 0.1,  milestones=[200,400], which means
- lr = 0.001 if epoch < 200
- lr = 0.0001 if 200 < epoch < 400
- lr = 0.00001 if epoch > 400

### Another approach
In DeepNAT[1], they separates foreground from background before the segmentation, in our case, the background represent a very large amount of pixels, as a result, it's necessary to first remove the background. There is a simple way implemented by QuickNAT in [Github](https://github.com/ai-med/quickNAT_pytorch/blob/master/utils/preprocessor.py), it simply add up all the  pixels whose class frequency is less than a threshold. The same strategy will be used.
