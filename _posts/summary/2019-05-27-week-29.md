From the results from Resnet18 Training, I find that the network is not capable of learning all the features. So the training with res101 is performed on several data sets. Parameter size: 27,542,543

|Group Id|iteration|Loss|Batch size|
|0|200|0.02|4|
|1|200|0.08|4|
|2|200|0.13|4|
|3|470|0.135|4|
|4|450|0.122|4|
|5|450|0.119|4|

The next step will focus on QuickNAT, Parameter size: 3,515,346
