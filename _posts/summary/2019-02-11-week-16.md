### Paper Review

#### Zhuang, Juntang. “LadderNet: Multi-Path Networks Based on U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation.” ArXiv:1810.07810 [Cs, Eess], Oct. 2018. arXiv.org. [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07810)
1. LadderNet: a chain of multiple U-Net, it has multiple pairs of encoder-decoder branches, and has skip connections between every pair of adjacent decoder and decoder branches in each level.



#### Alom, Zahangir, et al. Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network Based on U-Net (R2U-Net) for Medical Image Segmentation. p. 12.[Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06955.pdf)

1. Recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) based on U-Net (RU-Net) as well as a Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network based on U-Net (R2U-Net) models. The Proposed deep learning models are the building blocks of the stacked convolutional units shown in Fig. 4(b) and (d).

2. Database:
  - blood vessel segmentation in retina image
  - skin cancer segmentation
  - lung lesion segmentation
3. Same number of network parameters with better performance against U-net.
4. Retina blood vessel segmentation:
  - DRIVE: 40 color images. 20 for training, 20 for testing. original image size is 565 x 584, cropped to 565 x 565. 190,000 randomly selected patches (48x48) 171,000 for training, 19,000 for validation.
  - STARE: 20 color images. original image size 700x605. Training is performed with randomly selected samples from all 20 images. Using 'leave-one-out' strategy where 19 randomly selected samples are used for training, 1 for test. 250,000 patches where 225,000 for training, 25,000 for validation.
  - CHASH_DB1: 28 color images, size 999 x 960. 20 samples for training and 8 samples for testing.
5. Skin Cancer segmentation: (Adam optimization)
  - 2000 samples in total. 1250 training, 150 validation and 600 testing. Original size: 700x900, rescaled to 256x256.
6. Lung Segmentation:
  - 534 2D samples, 70% are used for training and 30% are used for testing. Original image size is 512 x 512, resized to 256x256.
