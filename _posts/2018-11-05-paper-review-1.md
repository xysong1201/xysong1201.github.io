### QuickNAT : A deep fully convolution neural network (F-CNN) 
* First, apply FreeSurfer to segment scans without annotations.
* Second, fine-tune the previous network with the limited manually annotated data.

### Conclusion
* The fully convolutional architecture offers faster processing and lager context than path-based DeepNAT.
* The dense connections within every encoder and decoder block promote feature re-usibility in the network.
