A commonly adopted approch is training on image patches that are equally sampled from each class[1]. This, however, biases the classifier towards rare classes and may result in over-segmentation. To counter this, [2] proposes to train a second CNN on samples with a class distribution close to the real one, but oversample pixels that were incorrectly classified in the first stage. In practice, two stage training schemes can be prone to overfit- ting and sensitive to the state of the first classifier.
