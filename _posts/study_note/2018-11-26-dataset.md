### One-Pass Multi-task convolutional Neural Networks for Efficient Brain Tumor Segmentation
* Contribution: light and clean deep model that conducts brain tumor segmentation in
a single-pass and solves the class imbalance problem better than model
cascade.
1. decompose brain tumor segmentation into three different but related tasks and propose a multi-task deep model that trains them together to exploit their underlying correlation.
2. design a curriculum learning-based training strategy that trains the above multi-task model more effectively.
3. Introduce a simple effective post-processing method that can further improve the segmentation performance.
