### Problem
Since the dataset consists of Analyze 7.5 format files. I want to find if there is already the software package to deal with the dataset.

### Trial

#### Nibabel
First, I find the Nibabel
* Advantage: This package provides read +/- write access to some common medical and neuroimaging file formats, including: ANALYZE (plain, SPM99, SPM2 and later), GIFTI, NIfTI1, NIfTI2, MINC1, MINC2, MGH and ECAT as well as Philips PAR/REC.
* Disadvantage: it's too complicated without a clear representation for the plotting.

#### Nilearn

* Advantage: Diverse plotting method.
* Suitable for dealing with Analyze 7.5 format.

#### Pydicom
* A software package for dealing with DICOM files

#### Nipype
Nipype consists of many parts, but the main ones are Interfaces, the Workflow Engine and the Execution Plugins.

Find [__BIDS__](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/): a simple and intuitive way to organize and describe neuroimaging and behavioral data.
