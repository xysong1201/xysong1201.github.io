### ISBI challenge dataset

The original dataset is from isbi challenge(http://brainiac2.mit.edu/isbi_challenge/).
The training and test datasets are two stacks of 30 sections from a serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) data set of the Drosophila first instar larva ventral nerve cord (VNC). The microcube measures 2 x 2 x 1.5 microns approx., with a resolution of 4x4x50 nm/pixel.
