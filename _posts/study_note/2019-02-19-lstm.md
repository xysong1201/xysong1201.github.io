A recurrent neural network can be thought of as multiple copies of the same network, each passing a message to a successor. RNN are used for sequences and lists.

Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem.
