### Multi-atlas Segmentation
First, the *n* most similar atlases to the query image are selected and registered to the query image; Second, the same registration transformations are applied to the labels of the *n* atlases, and these labels are propagated to produce n segmentations of the query image; Finally the segmentations are combined using a fusion strategy.
